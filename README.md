# Generate-random-pieces-of-text-given-a-start-bigram-
Natural Language Processing


This project is divided into 2 parts:

1- First part is to calculate probabilities needed to generate the random sentence.

2- Using probabilities calculated from the first part, I used it to generate random sentences until fixed number of words.


The dataset used in this project is single-docs dataset.

To run the code, install single-docs dataset and put it in the same directory of the file RandomSentence.py
